    "*Python* is a high-level programming language, which is highly versatile, relatively accessible, and extremely well-supported. If you've never programmed before, Python is a great language to start with. A couple of the good reasons for this are: by the standards of programming languages, it is easy for humans to read; and, instead of spending a lot of time worrying about defining rigid types and arranging things in multiple files, it is quick to get started with actually doing things with Python."
